description="Super Player EX is the ultra-enhanced version of the original mod Player EX, which let you apply a rainbow effect to yourself. This effect went over any hats, dyes, and outfits you chose to wear.[br][br][br]Now, you can apply 12 different effects ranging from the original Rainbow to becoming a literal Blob (It's called Melting, check it out).[br][br][br]You can also change the intensity of the effect to match your style, it's all about you![br][br][br]In addition, I can proudly announce that this mod features Online Support with compatibility for Online Party Plus and Playables![br] When I first made the mod, I thought it would never happen so I was amazed when it did. (Just don't expect perfection, this was a struggle)[br][br][br]Embody the power of Death Wish bosses, the ferocity of fire, the coolness of ice, or the energy of the Blob with the new and improved Super Player EX!"
